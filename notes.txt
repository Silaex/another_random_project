This is where I will put some bug or else and maybe sometimes come back to it and resolve some issues :-)

[ ] Being able to put "structure precision" on 'fb' types [Example: Array<Array<Number>>].
    So only a two level array with numbers could pass.
    IDEA: because this will be in a String like this "Array<Array<Number>>" we will need to put some TOKEN??KEY???SYMBOL??? to recognize INSTANCE from TYPES like this maybe...
            Type(Type): "Array<Array<Number>>"
            Instance(*Instance): "Array<Array<*Number>>"

[x] Being able to put an "Any" type thing => 'fb'

[ ] Puzzle must always be surrounded by walls. The only opening
should be a DOOR cell to another puzzle
