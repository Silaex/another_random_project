This is where I will put some bug or else and maybe sometimes come back to it and resolve some issues :-)

[ ] Being able to put "structure precision" on 'fb' types [Example: Array<Array<Number>>].
    So only a two level array with numbers could pass.

[x] Being able to put an "Any" type thing => 'fb'
